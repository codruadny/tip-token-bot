I'm building a Telegram tipping bot from scratch for a Polygon-based memecoin called TIP Token. This project will evolve into a full ecosystem with gamification, multi-language UX, staking, airdrops, and real-time interaction between Telegram, Polygon smart contracts, and Supabase.

🔐 BOT CREDENTIALS:
Use this bot token:

ruby
Copy
Edit
7885838956:AAEIz5M0CW2iWbhuh9lQ0l-3HsGaelgMIIw
Store it as a secret using os.getenv("BOT_TOKEN")

This is a new bot, starting from zero

📦 CORE BOT LOGIC: Adjustments (1–15)
Use async architecture — Python + Aiogram or Node.js + Telegraf/GramJS

Use webhook-based updates, not polling

Implement regex-based command parsing (/tip, /send, /rain)

Enable reply-to-message tipping

Use an in-memory cache (Redis or Supabase memory) for fast balance reads

Add concurrency control (idempotency keys to avoid double sends)

Deploy on a scalable host (e.g., Fly.io, Render, Heroku)

Add multi-language support (EN, RU, CN, ES) via locale JSON files

Register slash commands with BotFather for discoverability

Implement inline mode (@botname <query>) for fast tipping

Add custom keyboards for actions (e.g., /balance, /tip)

Build a /start onboarding wizard with guided steps

Make the UI mobile + desktop friendly

Include an admin mode (pause bot, force mint, etc.)

Add command cooldown (e.g., 3s per user to avoid spam)

🌉 POLYGON INTEGRATION: Adjustments (16–30)
Connect to a Polygon RPC (Infura, Alchemy, or public)

Use Thirdweb SDK for interacting with TIP token smart contract

Implement gasless transactions using relayers (Thirdweb, OZ Defender)

Add /deposit → Generate user-specific Polygon wallet

Add /withdraw → Withdraw TIP tokens to external wallet

Include a faucet for new users to get TIP (with rate limit)

Allow external wallet linking via EIP-4361 or QR sign-in

Store encrypted private keys (custodial users) securely

Enable multi-chain support (for ETH, BSC, etc.)

Implement /airdrop → multi-send to users

Integrate CoinGecko or Chainlink price feeds

Add on-chain alerts (e.g., deposits/withdrawals)

Cover gas for users via sponsored MATIC

Enable emergency fund recovery via multisig fallback

Build a Polygon event listener to track live on-chain TIP activity

🎮 GAMIFICATION & ENGAGEMENT: Adjustments (31–55)
Add 🎁 daily check-in reward

Implement Tap-to-Earn (Notcoin-style)

Add /referral system using .start param

Reward tiered invites (5 = 100 TIP, 10 = 300 TIP)

Build weekly referral leaderboard

Add missions/quests (e.g., “Tip a friend”)

Integrate task rewards (e.g., Twitter, YouTube)

Create a streak system for daily tipping

Run seasonal events (e.g., “Top 10K = 100 TIP”)

Add mini-games: quizzes, raffles, mystery tips

Track badges (e.g., “Top Tipper”)

Launch a TIP shop (buy boosts, stickers, emojis)

Add lottery + ticketing system

Create a virtual tipping market (buy cosmetic roles)

Add referral multipliers (e.g., 2x for 24 hrs)

Burn TIP on specific actions (e.g., boost entries)

Add governance via TIP staking (community votes)

Create boost mechanics (earn more for 1 hr)

Form guilds/teams → leaderboard competition

Cooldown rewards (e.g., “Claim every 4h”)

Use fun emoji/animations (🎉, 💸, 🚀)

Allow nicknames for TIP

Sell custom emojis/stickers via TIP

Add external partner quests (e.g., stake on dApp)

Track full reward progression with XP bars

💸 TOKENOMICS: Adjustments (56–70)
Cap TIP supply and implement emissions curve

Add auto-burning % on tipping or airdrops

Launch staking: TIP stakers earn yield

Share bot revenue with stakers

Offer fee discounts for TIP payments

Build liquidity incentives for TIP on DEXes

Auto-stake options for earnings

Reserve TIP for airdrops, quests, growth

Budget referral rewards in TIP

Announce airdrops to build hype

Burn TIP after key milestones

Reward high-activity users with rebates

Vesting logic for team/community

Add token migration support

Show live TIP stats (supply, burns) via /supply

🎨 UX, COMMUNITY, ANALYTICS: Adjustments (71–90)
Simplify onboarding (3 guided steps)

Add instant feedback messages (e.g., “You tipped 50 TIP!”)

Improve error responses (e.g., “Not enough balance”)

Design beautiful /help command with examples

Responsive UI (mobile inline buttons)

Use emoji confetti or effects for rewards

Show prices in fiat (USD, EUR)

Add /profile with stats (tips, referrals)

Push notifications for milestones

Channel for airdrop/news

Community support group

Moderator tools (/ban, /mute)

Social sharing buttons (referral tweets)

Track DAU/WAU/MAU

Analytics dashboard (Supabase, GDS)

Conversion tracking (ref → signup → action)

Weekly leaderboard with pinned updates

Certs of achievement (image + stats)

Multilingual groups (EN/RU/ES/CN)

Auto-announce top users in group

🔒 SECURITY & RELIABILITY: Adjustments (91–100)
Add per-user/IP rate limits

Sanitize all inputs (regex validation)

Anti-spam (e.g., require group membership)

Use Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS)

Add error logging (Sentry, Telegram DM, etc.)

Create backup/restore logic for all data

Encrypt user wallets & keys at rest

Add privacy disclaimer (what data is collected)

Keep all secrets in .env or Replit Secrets

Conduct audit on smart contract + backend before launch

📌 FINAL REQUEST:
Please generate:

A modular bot boilerplate using aiogram (preferred) or Node.js + Telegraf

With proper command folder structure

Command: /start, /help, /register, /tip, /wallet, /balance, /referral, /transactions

All handlers should be async-ready and split into modules

Include uptime support (Flask or webhook mode)

Add comments for every major section so I can expand later

Use uvicorn or gunicorn for deployment if needed

100% Replit-deployable AND Fly.io-compatible

This is the start of a long-term ecosystem. Build it right from the start.
